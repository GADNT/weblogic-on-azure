# Weblogic on Azure
This repository shows how to deploy a Java EE application to Azure using WebLogic and Linux virtual machines. The repository hosts the demos for this [talk](abstract.md) or [this](lab-abstract.md) lab.

The basic Java EE application used throughout is in the [javaee](javaee/) folder. You should set up and explore this application on your local machine.
